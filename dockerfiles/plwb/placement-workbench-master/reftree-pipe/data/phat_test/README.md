Test data for the "autoref" workflow, using the PhAT algorithm.

Files are obtained from the SILVA database, version 138.1, from which I selected just the sequences/taxopaths matching "Cyanobacteriia".

Aligned sequences obtained from "SILVA_138.1_SSURef_NR99_tax_silva_full_align_trunc.fasta.gz", which contains the aligned 16S/18S SILVA sequences, clustered to 99% identity.
